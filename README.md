# Single-Cycle-CPU
I designed and implemented a Single Cycle CPU. 
The CPU will act upon a 32-bit instruction and provide a result within one clock cycle, hence the name Single Cycle. The instructions are solely based on MIPS architecture sets, where all instructions are of 32-bits. The components in the CPU that I analyzed included a 32x32 but register file, an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), memory modules, and others. All of the components will work in conjunctuon to become a Single Cycle CPU. The CPU can perform: 
      1) Addition of unsigned integers
      2) Subtraction of unsigned integers
      3) Bitwise OR
      4) Bitwise AND
      5) Bitwise XOR
      6) Add Immediate
      7) Subtract Immediate
      8) OR Immediate
      9) AND Immediate
      10) Branch Equal
      11) Multiply Unsigned Integers
      12) Divide Unsigned Integers
      13) Load Word
      14) Store Word
